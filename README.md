# SQL Bootcamp 2023

Before we meet on August 5th, please complete the following:
======
1. Watch two videos as a primer for databases and SQL. These are short and a little funny, but they explain the concepts very well!

2. Prepare your environment on the machine you'll be bringing to the bootcamp by completing the following 4 steps. If you need an administrator's approval for software downloads, please take care of that prior to the bootcamp. <br>
[Step 1: Docker](https://github.com/emilyadale/sql_bootcamp/blob/main/Environment%20Setup/Step%201:%20Docker.md) <br>
[Step 2: SQL IDE](https://github.com/emilyadale/sql_bootcamp/blob/main/Environment%20Setup/Step%202:%20SQL%20IDE.md) <br>
[Step 3: Download the Database](https://github.com/emilyadale/sql_bootcamp/blob/main/Environment%20Setup/Step%203:%20Download%20the%20Database.md) <br>
[Step 4: Optional (but helpful) customizations](https://github.com/emilyadale/sql_bootcamp/blob/main/Environment%20Setup/Step%204%3A%20Customizations.md) <br>
   


Why is setup required?
======
In order to be able to run SQL on your local machine, you need three things:
1. Somewhere to host a database
2. A tool (IDE) in which to query the database
3. A database

These instructions will guide you through each step in the process. Make sure to follow them in order to avoid any issues.

Before starting these instructions, make sure you have the following:
------
1. Know your computer type, model, and OS version. Macs and Window machines run slightly differently!
   I have designated system-specific instructions using the following logos: <br>

3. Ensure you have administrative permissions on your machine or can obtain these during the downloads.
4. If you run into trouble, email me any time at emily.dale@rockhurst.edu. Make sure to note which section and step you are on.
   Some sections will have troubleshooting tips. These will be designated with this image: <br>
